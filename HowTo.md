## Setup Local Development Environment:
The setup guide provides detailed instructions on how to setup the local development environment.


## Setup Data:
* Load subset of data from whatever the upstream data source is and simulate landing table.
    * Create as many "data simulation" dags as needed for different samples of data acc to exploration needs.
    * These "data simulation" dags are for local development. 
    * Manually triggered
* Backfill data needed for exploration:
    * Use airflow to backfill the data needed for exploration
